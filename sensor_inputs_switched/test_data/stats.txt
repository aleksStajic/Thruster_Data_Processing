Note: For this test, inputs to each amplifier were swapped. Voltage readings are current readings, current readings
      are voltage readings. Original scaling factors were applied for consistency. I.e, current vs. time is actually 
      voltage vs. time with the 23.535 scaling factor applied. Voltage vs. time is actually current vs. time with the 
      4.878 scaling factor applied. 

      Worth noting, the current data is actually seen as the voltage data in the code, so the current data is getting 
      "curve fit", which is why the peak values seem lower than they should be in the stats.txt recordings. Visually, 
      there is no discernible difference between the raw current vs. time plot in this dataset and the current vs. time
      plot in the "normal configuration" dataset. Swapping inputs to EVMs does not seem to make a difference.
